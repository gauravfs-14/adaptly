**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Process

1. **Email the maintainer directly**:
   - **Email**: [Your security email]
   - **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability in Adaptly"
   - **Include**: Detailed description of the vulnerability

   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form

3. **Include the following information**:
   - **Description** of the vulnerability
   - **Steps to reproduce** the issue
   - **Potential impact** and severity
   - **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
   - **Your contact information** for follow-up

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide:

- **Detailed description** of the vulnerability
- **Proof of concept** or steps to reproduce
- **Affected versions** of Adaptly
- **Potential impact** on users
- **Suggested remediation** (if known)
- **Your contact information** for coordination

### Response Timeline

## Security Considerations

### AI and LLM Security

Adaptly integrates with AI services (Google Gemini). Security considerations include:

- **API Key Protection**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs before sending to LLM
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for AI requests
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data is handled securely

### Component Security

- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content in components
- **Props Validation**: Validate all component props
- **Safe Rendering**: Use safe rendering practices
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers

### Registry Security

- **Configuration Validation**: Validate adaptly.json configuration
- **Component Validation**: Ensure registered components are safe
- **Schema Validation**: Validate all registry schemas
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep dependencies updated**:

   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data:

   ```bash
   # Never commit API keys
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Validate all inputs**:

   ```typescript
   // Validate user inputs
   if (!input || typeof input !== 'string') {
     throw new Error('Invalid input');
   }
   ```

4. **Use HTTPS** in production:

   ```typescript
   // Ensure secure connections
   const apiUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
     ? 'https://api.example.com' 
     : 'http://localhost:3000';
   ```

5. **Implement proper error handling**:

   ```typescript
   try {
     // AI processing
   } catch (error) {
     // Log error securely
     console.error('AI processing failed:', error.message);
     // Don't expose sensitive information
   }
   ```

### For Users

1. **Protect your API keys**:
   - Never share API keys publicly
   - Use environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage

2. **Validate component registry**:
   - Only register trusted components
   - Validate component props
   - Review component code
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

3. **Secure your deployment**:
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Set up security headers
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities
