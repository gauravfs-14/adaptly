# What is Adaptly?

Adaptly is an AI-powered adaptive UI library that lets your React applications understand natural language and automatically rearrange components based on user intent. With a simple `‚åòK` command, users can describe what they want to see, and Adaptly uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically recompose your interface using your existing components.

## üéØ The Problem Adaptly Solves

Traditional dashboards and applications require users to:

- Navigate through complex menus to find features
- Manually configure layouts and filters
- Learn specific UI patterns and workflows
- Constantly switch between different views

**Adaptly changes this by letting users simply say what they want:**

> "Show me sales data for this quarter"  
> "Create a dashboard with revenue metrics"  
> "Add charts and filter by this week"

The AI understands the intent and automatically:

- Selects the right components from your registry
- Arranges them in an optimal layout
- Configures props and filters
- Updates the UI in real-time

## üöÄ Key Features

- **ü§ñ Multi-LLM Support:**  
  Choose from Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4, or Anthropic Claude with seamless provider switching at runtime.

- **üíæ Persistent Storage:**  
  Automatically saves and restores UI state across sessions with version control and migration support.

- **üìã Component Registry:**  
  Define your components in `adaptly.json` with descriptions, props, and use cases for AI understanding.

- **‚å®Ô∏è Built-in Command Interface:**  
  Press `‚åòK` to open the command bar with AI suggestions and natural language input.

- **üîç Smart Data Filtering:**  
  LLM can filter and configure existing data without passing new data - perfect for security and performance.

- **üîß TypeScript First:**  
  Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces and IntelliSense support.

- **‚ö° Next.js Ready:**  
  Seamless integration with App Router and React 19+ support.

```

### 1. **Component Registry**

You define your components in `adaptly.json` with descriptions, props, and use cases:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "components": {
    "MetricCard": {
      "description": "Display key performance indicators with values, trends, and progress bars",
      "props": {
        "title": { "type": "string", "required": true },
        "value": { "type": "string", "required": true },
        "change": { "type": "string", "required": false }
      },
      "useCases": ["revenue tracking", "user metrics", "KPI display"],
      "space": { "min": [2, 1], "max": [3, 2], "preferred": [2, 1] }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **AI Processing**

When a user says "Show me revenue metrics", the LLM:

- Analyzes the request against your component registry
- Selects appropriate components (MetricCard)
- Generates props and layout configuration
- Returns a structured plan

### 3. **Dynamic Rendering**

Adaptly renders the components using your actual React components:

```tsx
<AdaptlyProvider
  apiKey="your-api-key"
  provider="google"
  model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
  components={{ MetricCard, SalesChart, TeamMembers }}
  adaptlyConfig={adaptlyConfig}
  enableStorage={true}
/>
```

### 4. **Persistent State**

All changes are automatically saved to localStorage and restored on page reload.

## üéØ Real-World Use Cases
