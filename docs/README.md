## üéØ What You'll Learn

After reading this documentation, you'll be able to:

- **Build AI-powered interfaces** that respond to natural language
- **Create adaptive layouts** that rearrange based on user needs
- **Register and manage components** in the AI system
- **Customize the command interface** for your specific use cases
- **Deploy production applications** with confidence
- **Extend Adaptly** with custom functionality

## üí° Key Concepts

### AI-Driven UI Generation

Adaptly uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand user intent and generate appropriate UI layouts. Users describe what they want in natural language, and the AI creates the interface.

### Component Registry

The registry system allows you to define what components are available to the AI, their properties, use cases, and space requirements. This gives the AI context about your application's capabilities.

### Adaptive Layouts

The layout system dynamically arranges components based on AI suggestions, user preferences, and available space. It supports grid, flex, and absolute positioning.

### Command Interface

The `‚åòK` command interface provides a natural language input method for users to describe their UI needs. It's built on top of shadcn/ui's Command component.

## üîß Prerequisites

Before diving into the documentation, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for development
- **React 19+** - Core framework dependency
- **TypeScript knowledge** - For type safety and better DX
- **Basic React concepts** - Components, hooks, context
- **Google Gemini API key** - For AI functionality (optional but recommended)
